Interactive Angry Birds using OpenCV by Shivali Chandra and Shruti Iyer

Using keyboard controls, the player can move the bird relative to a point on the screen, and can then launch it with the space bar in a manner similar to a slingshot. There are three levels of the game; as the player hits the target, the next stage has an increasingly more difficult, moving target to hit. In each game, the player is given five birds, or ‘lives’. The player is able to see their current score and amount of lives. When they run out of lives, the game automatically closes.

The code is automated and hence does not need any inputs from the user. It can be run both from the the Sublime window and Terminal.

The helper function was downloaded to help the game load images. Source: http://www.pygame.org/docs/tut/chimp/ChimpLineByLine.html
