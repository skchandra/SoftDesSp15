My results indicate that I have significant proteins of salmonella, as seen by the nearly 100% match of certain proteins and amino acids to 'antigen presentation protein SpaN [Salmonella enterica]', 'type III secretion system protein SpaS [Salmonella bongori]', 'Invasion protein InvJ [Salmonella enterica]', and similar proteins. These results validate that my code was written properly. Also, it was interesting to see the different types of proteins that are found in and cause salmonella, and it would be interesting to learn more about.
