1. What is the general trend in the curve?
Upwards, as percentage of data increases so too does accuracy overall. 

2. Are there parts of the curve that appear to be noisier than others? Why?
Each time run, there are a few noisy sections because due to the random number generation, there are bound to be some outliers that throw off that particular area of the graph. 

3. How many trials do you need to get a smooth curve?
High 40's were pretty close, but 50 was the lowest number of trials that produced a fairly smooth curve. 

4. Try different values for C. What happens? 
Increasing the value of the exponent decreased accuracy and added more noise.
